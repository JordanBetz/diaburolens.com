                    The contents of our pages have been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 Para.1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) and general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

                    Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, the contents of which we have no influence on. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. Upon becoming aware of violations of the law, we will remove such links immediately.<br><br><strong>Copyright</strong><br><br>
